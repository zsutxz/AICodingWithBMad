# Unity 2D Gomoku Game Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a complete, playable Unity 2D Gomoku game within a 4-week development timeline
- Achieve at least 4.5/5 overall user experience rating in initial user testing
- Create a comprehensive case study demonstrating the effectiveness of the BMAD-METHOD™ framework
- Ensure the game runs at 60 FPS on modern hardware with smooth animations
- Enable players to understand game rules and start playing within 1 minute of launch
- Achieve 80% or higher game completion rate in test sessions
- Maintain less than 5% of user interactions resulting in confusion or errors

### Background Context

The digital Gomoku (Five in a Row) game market faces a dilemma between authenticity to traditional board game experiences and modern, engaging gameplay features. Many existing implementations either focus solely on basic game mechanics without sufficient polish or add excessive features that compromise the elegant simplicity of the original game. This project addresses this gap by creating a refined Gomoku game that balances traditional Chinese board game heritage with modern usability principles.

Additionally, there is a lack of practical case studies demonstrating effective Unity game AI-assisted development workflows. Many developers struggle to organize AI collaboration in game development, leading to inconsistent results and difficulty maintaining code quality. The lack of standardized approaches makes effective AI utilization throughout the development lifecycle challenging.

This project solves these problems by creating a polished Gomoku game that balances authenticity with modern usability, while serving as a comprehensive example of AI-assisted development using the BMAD-METHOD™ framework.
