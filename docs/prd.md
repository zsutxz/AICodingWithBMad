# Unity 2D Gomoku Game Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a polished Unity 2D Gomoku game that demonstrates traditional Chinese board game mechanics
- Provide an engaging local multiplayer experience for two players
- Establish a solid foundation for future feature expansion (AI opponents, online multiplayer, advanced rules)
- Serve as a practical case study for BMAD-METHOD development workflow
- Deliver a complete, playable game with intuitive user interface and smooth gameplay

### Background Context
This project addresses the need for a well-structured Unity 2D game development example that showcases modern development practices. Traditional Gomoku (五子棋) is a popular Chinese board game with simple rules but deep strategic possibilities. By creating this game using the BMAD-METHOD framework, we demonstrate how AI-assisted development can streamline the creation of polished, feature-complete games while maintaining code quality and documentation standards.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create an elegant, minimalist interface that emphasizes the traditional Chinese board game aesthetic while providing modern, intuitive interactions. The design should feel clean and uncluttered, allowing the game board to be the central focus. Navigation should be straightforward with clear visual hierarchy and immediate feedback for all user actions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Direct manipulation**: Click/tap on board intersections for piece placement
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show only relevant controls based on game state
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual and audio responses for all interactions
- **Consistent navigation**: Clear paths between game states (menu → game → results)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Menu**: Clean landing page with prominent "Start Game" button, settings access, and exit option
- **Game Screen**: Central 15x15 board with turn indicator, player information, and game controls
- **Pause Menu**: Overlay with resume, settings, and return to main menu options
- **Game Results**: Clear victory/defeat screen with replay and menu options
- **Settings Screen**: Simple toggle controls for sound and basic preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
- High contrast between board and pieces for visibility
- Clear visual indicators for turn changes and game states
- Support for keyboard navigation where applicable
- Scalable UI elements for different screen sizes

### Branding
Traditional Chinese aesthetic with modern minimalism:
- Color palette inspired by traditional Go/Weiqi boards (dark wood tones, stone colors)
- Clean typography using TextMeshPro for crisp text rendering
- Subtle Asian-inspired design elements without cultural appropriation
- Professional, polished appearance suitable for both casual and serious players

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
- Primary: Desktop (Windows/Mac) with mouse input
- Secondary: Touch devices (tablets) with touch input support
- Responsive UI scaling for different screen sizes and aspect ratios

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all Unity project files, documentation, and build configurations. This simplifies dependency management and ensures all game assets are version-controlled together.

### Service Architecture
**Monolithic Unity Application** - All game logic, UI, and assets contained within a single Unity project. No external services or APIs required for MVP. Game state managed entirely in-memory during gameplay.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration** - Focus on core game logic unit tests (win detection, move validation) and integration tests for UI interactions. Manual testing for gameplay flow and user experience validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Development Environment:**
- Unity 2022.3 LTS (Long Term Support version for stability)
- C# as primary programming language
- Visual Studio 2022 or Rider as IDE
- Git for version control

**Core Technologies:**
- Unity UI system for all interface elements
- TextMeshPro for high-quality text rendering
- Unity's built-in AudioSource for sound management
- 2D Sprite system for game board and pieces
- Unity's Input System for cross-platform input handling

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for game state management
- Event-driven architecture for game events and UI updates
- Scriptable Objects for game configuration and settings
- Singleton pattern for global managers (GameManager, AudioManager)

**Asset Management:**
- Use Unity's Addressable Asset System for efficient asset loading
- Standard Unity import settings for 2D sprites and audio
- Prefab-based approach for reusable UI components

**Build & Deployment:**
- Build targets: Windows Standalone (primary), Mac OSX (secondary)
- Unity Cloud Build for automated builds
- Version numbering following Semantic Versioning

**Performance Considerations:**
- Object pooling for frequently instantiated/destroyed game objects
- Minimal use of Update() methods, prefer event-driven updates
- Efficient collision detection using Unity's 2D physics system
- Optimized sprite atlases for reduced draw calls
