# Epic 1 Foundation & Core Gameplay

**Goal:** Establish the complete Unity project infrastructure and implement the fundamental Gomoku game mechanics to deliver a basic but fully functional playable game. This epic creates the foundation for all subsequent features by implementing core game rules, board interaction, and win detection.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Scene Structure

As a developer,
I want to set up the Unity project with proper folder structure and basic scene management,
so that we have a solid foundation for game development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Unity project created with 2022.3 LTS version
2. Organized folder structure for Scripts, Prefabs, Scenes, and Assets
3. Main scene created with basic camera and lighting setup
4. Scene management system implemented for switching between scenes
5. Basic game manager script created to handle game state transitions
6. Project builds successfully to Windows standalone target

### Story 1.2: Game Board Creation and Display

As a player,
I want to see a 15x15 game board with clear grid lines and intersections,
so that I can understand the playing area and make strategic moves.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 15x15 game board rendered with visible grid lines
2. Board background uses appropriate traditional Chinese aesthetic
3. Grid intersections are clearly marked and spaced evenly
4. Board scales appropriately to different screen sizes
5. Board is centered on screen with proper margins
6. Grid coordinates optionally visible for debugging purposes

### Story 1.3: Basic Piece Placement System

As a player,
I want to click on board intersections to place black and white pieces alternately,
so that I can play the basic game of Gomoku.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Click detection on board intersections works accurately
2. Black and white pieces placed alternately on valid intersections
3. Pieces cannot be placed on occupied intersections
4. Visual feedback shows valid placement locations
5. Turn indicator displays which player's turn it is
6. Piece placement is immediate with no noticeable lag

### Story 1.4: Gomoku Win Detection Logic

As a player,
I want the game to automatically detect when five pieces are connected in a row,
so that I know when the game is won and who the winner is.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Win detection works for horizontal five-in-a-row connections
2. Win detection works for vertical five-in-a-row connections
3. Win detection works for diagonal five-in-a-row connections
4. Game state transitions to "game over" when win is detected
5. Winner is correctly identified and displayed
6. No false positives for win detection in normal gameplay

### Story 1.5: Basic Game Flow and State Management

As a player,
I want to start a new game, play through to completion, and see the results,
so that I can have a complete gaming session.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. New game can be started from initial state
2. Game progresses through turns until win condition is met
3. Game over screen displays winner and basic statistics
4. Option to return to main menu from game over screen
5. Game state is properly reset when starting new game
6. No memory leaks or state corruption between games
