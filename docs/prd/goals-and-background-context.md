# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a polished Unity 2D Gomoku game that demonstrates traditional Chinese board game mechanics
- Provide an engaging local multiplayer experience for two players
- Establish a solid foundation for future feature expansion (AI opponents, online multiplayer, advanced rules)
- Serve as a practical case study for BMAD-METHOD development workflow
- Deliver a complete, playable game with intuitive user interface and smooth gameplay

### Background Context
This project addresses the need for a well-structured Unity 2D game development example that showcases modern development practices. Traditional Gomoku (五子棋) is a popular Chinese board game with simple rules but deep strategic possibilities. By creating this game using the BMAD-METHOD framework, we demonstrate how AI-assisted development can streamline the creation of polished, feature-complete games while maintaining code quality and documentation standards.
