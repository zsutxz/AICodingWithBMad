# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create an elegant, minimalist interface that emphasizes the traditional Chinese board game aesthetic while providing modern, intuitive interactions. The design should feel clean and uncluttered, allowing the game board to be the central focus. Navigation should be straightforward with clear visual hierarchy and immediate feedback for all user actions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Direct manipulation**: Click/tap on board intersections for piece placement
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show only relevant controls based on game state
- **Immediate feedback**: Visual and audio responses for all interactions
- **Consistent navigation**: Clear paths between game states (menu → game → results)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Menu**: Clean landing page with prominent "Start Game" button, settings access, and exit option
- **Game Screen**: Central 15x15 board with turn indicator, player information, and game controls
- **Pause Menu**: Overlay with resume, settings, and return to main menu options
- **Game Results**: Clear victory/defeat screen with replay and menu options
- **Settings Screen**: Simple toggle controls for sound and basic preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
- High contrast between board and pieces for visibility
- Clear visual indicators for turn changes and game states
- Support for keyboard navigation where applicable
- Scalable UI elements for different screen sizes

### Branding
Traditional Chinese aesthetic with modern minimalism:
- Color palette inspired by traditional Go/Weiqi boards (dark wood tones, stone colors)
- Clean typography using TextMeshPro for crisp text rendering
- Subtle Asian-inspired design elements without cultural appropriation
- Professional, polished appearance suitable for both casual and serious players

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
- Primary: Desktop (Windows/Mac) with mouse input
- Secondary: Touch devices (tablets) with touch input support
- Responsive UI scaling for different screen sizes and aspect ratios
