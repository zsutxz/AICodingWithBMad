# Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all Unity project files, documentation, and build configurations. This simplifies dependency management and ensures all game assets are version-controlled together.

### Service Architecture
**Monolithic Unity Application** - All game logic, UI, and assets contained within a single Unity project. No external services or APIs required for MVP. Game state managed entirely in-memory during gameplay.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration** - Focus on core game logic unit tests (win detection, move validation) and integration tests for UI interactions. Manual testing for gameplay flow and user experience validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Development Environment:**
- Unity 2022.3 LTS (Long Term Support version for stability)
- C# as primary programming language
- Visual Studio 2022 or Rider as IDE
- Git for version control

**Core Technologies:**
- Unity UI system for all interface elements
- TextMeshPro for high-quality text rendering
- Unity's built-in AudioSource for sound management
- 2D Sprite system for game board and pieces
- Unity's Input System for cross-platform input handling

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for game state management
- Event-driven architecture for game events and UI updates
- Scriptable Objects for game configuration and settings
- Singleton pattern for global managers (GameManager, AudioManager)

**Asset Management:**
- Use Unity's Addressable Asset System for efficient asset loading
- Standard Unity import settings for 2D sprites and audio
- Prefab-based approach for reusable UI components

**Build & Deployment:**
- Build targets: Windows Standalone (primary), Mac OSX (secondary)
- Unity Cloud Build for automated builds
- Version numbering following Semantic Versioning

**Performance Considerations:**
- Object pooling for frequently instantiated/destroyed game objects
- Minimal use of Update() methods, prefer event-driven updates
- Efficient collision detection using Unity's 2D physics system
- Optimized sprite atlases for reduced draw calls
