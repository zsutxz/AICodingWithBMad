# Project Brief: Unity 2D Gomoku Game

## Executive Summary
The Unity 2D Gomoku game is a modern implementation of the traditional Chinese board game (五子棋) that combines classic gameplay with contemporary development practices. This project aims to create a polished, engaging local multiplayer experience that serves both as an entertaining game and a practical case study for AI-assisted development using the BMAD-METHOD™ framework. The primary target market includes casual board game enthusiasts and developers interested in Unity 2D game development. The key value proposition is providing an accessible, visually appealing Gomoku game with intuitive controls while demonstrating best practices in structured, AI-driven game development.

## Problem Statement
The current landscape of digital Gomoku (五子棋) games often presents a trade-off between authenticity to the traditional board game experience and modern, engaging gameplay features. Many existing implementations either focus purely on the basic game mechanics without sufficient polish, or they add excessive features that detract from the elegant simplicity of the original game. This creates a gap in the market for a well-balanced Gomoku game that respects the traditional Chinese board game heritage while providing a smooth, intuitive user experience with modern development standards.

Additionally, there is a need for practical case studies that demonstrate effective AI-assisted development workflows for Unity games. Many developers struggle with structuring AI collaboration in game development, leading to inconsistent results and difficulty maintaining code quality. The lack of standardized approaches makes it challenging to leverage AI effectively throughout the entire development lifecycle.

The impact of these problems is evident in user dissatisfaction with existing Gomoku implementations that feel either too basic or overly complicated, as well as in development teams' inability to consistently produce high-quality games using AI assistance. This project addresses these issues by creating a polished Gomoku game that balances tradition with modern usability while serving as a comprehensive example of the BMAD-METHOD™ framework for AI-driven development.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Unity 2D Gomoku game that combines the traditional rules and aesthetics of the Chinese board game with modern, polished gameplay mechanics and user interface design. The game will implement the core Gomoku rules (15x15 board, alternating black and white pieces, five-in-a-row victory condition) while incorporating smooth animations, intuitive controls, and thoughtful user experience design to create an engaging local multiplayer experience.

The solution will be developed using the BMAD-METHOD™ framework, which provides a structured approach to AI-assisted development. This framework ensures consistent documentation, clear separation of concerns, and systematic implementation of features through defined workflows. The development process will follow an incremental approach, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes the essential game mechanics and progressively adding polish and additional features.

Key differentiators from existing solutions include:
- A focus on traditional Chinese aesthetics with modern minimalism, creating a visually distinctive game that honors its cultural roots
- Implementation of the BMAD-METHOD™ framework, providing a reproducible process for AI-assisted game development
- Emphasis on user experience with smooth animations, clear visual feedback, and intuitive navigation
- Modular architecture that allows for easy extension with additional features like AI opponents or online multiplayer in the future

This solution will succeed where others haven't by balancing authenticity to the traditional game with modern usability principles, while also serving as a comprehensive example of effective AI collaboration in game development.
