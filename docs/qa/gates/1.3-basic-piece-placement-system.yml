## Story Reference

## Summary
The basic piece placement system story is well-structured with clear acceptance criteria and technical specifications. However, several concerns need to be addressed before development begins to ensure quality implementation and adequate test coverage.

## Key Findings

### 1. Test Coverage Gaps (MEDIUM)
- Visual feedback system lacks specific test scenarios
- Turn indicator UI testing not explicitly planned
- Edge cases for rapid consecutive clicks not covered

### 2. Performance Considerations (MEDIUM)
- Using LateUpdate() for piece placement may cause conflicts
- Object pooling implementation details insufficient
- Missing fallback mechanisms for performance issues

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility (HIGH)
- Touch input handling needs more detailed specification
- Differences between mouse and touch interactions not defined
- Input System configuration lacks detail

### 4. Architecture References (MEDIUM)
- Multiple references to specific lines in architecture document need verification
- Potential mismatch between documented and actual file paths

## Requirements Assessment
- ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria clearly defined and testable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some testing scenarios need more specificity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance requirements could be more concrete

## Risk Assessment
- Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM
- Primary Risks: Input handling complexity, cross-platform compatibility
- Secondary Risks: Performance under load, architecture-document alignment

## Recommendations Before Development

1. **Enhanced Test Planning**:
   - Add specific test scenarios for visual feedback system
   - Define unit tests for turn indicator UI component
   - Include edge case testing for rapid consecutive clicks

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Clarify why LateUpdate() is preferred over other Unity lifecycle methods
   - Detail object pooling implementation approach
   - Define acceptable performance thresholds and fallback behaviors

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Specify expected behavior differences between touch and mouse input
   - Detail Input System configuration requirements
   - Plan for platform-specific testing

4. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Verify all architecture document references are accurate
   - Confirm file paths match actual implementation structure

## Approval Conditions
This story is approved to proceed to development with the following conditions:
1. All HIGH severity findings must be addressed before development begins
2. MEDIUM severity findings should be addressed or have mitigation plans documented
3. Updated test scenarios must be reviewed and approved
4. Architecture document references must be verified for accuracy

## Next Steps
‚úÖ Ready for development once conditions are met
üìÖ Follow-up review scheduled after addressing findings
