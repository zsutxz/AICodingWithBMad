   - Test invalid click positions return null/no detection

#### Integration Tests (PlayMode)
3. **Mouse Input Handling**
   - Test click detection accuracy across different screen resolutions
   - Verify no false positives on non-intersection areas
   - Test rapid consecutive clicks on same intersection

4. **Touch Input Handling**

   - Verify multi-touch scenarios handled appropriately
   - Test touch drag vs. tap differentiation

### 2. PiecePlacement Tests

#### Unit Tests (EditMode)
1. **Turn Management**
   - Verify black piece placed on first move
   - Confirm alternating turns between black and white players
   - Test turn state after valid placements

2. **Move Validation**
   - Verify pieces cannot be placed on occupied intersections
   - Confirm placement only allowed on valid intersections
   - Test boundary conditions (edges of board)

3. **State Management**
   - Verify GameBoardModel updates correctly after placements
   - Test moveHistory records all moves accurately
   - Confirm board state reset functionality

#### Integration Tests (PlayMode)
4. **Full Placement Flow**
   - Test complete sequence of valid piece placements
   - Verify no performance degradation over many placements
   - Test undo functionality (if implemented)

### 3. TurnManager Tests

#### Unit Tests (EditMode)
1. **Turn Tracking**
   - Verify initial state is black player's turn
   - Test turn alternation after valid moves
   - Confirm turn does not change after invalid moves

2. **State Persistence**
   - Test turn state maintained between scenes (if applicable)
   - Verify turn state correctly serialized/deserialized

#### Integration Tests (PlayMode)
3. **Turn Transitions**
   - Test visual turn indicator updates correctly
   - Verify no race conditions in turn updates
   - Test turn behavior after game state changes

### 4. Visual Feedback Tests

#### Unit Tests (EditMode)
1. **Highlight System**
   - Verify valid intersections highlighted appropriately
   - Test highlight appearance for different states
   - Confirm highlight disappearance after placement

#### Integration Tests (PlayMode)
2. **Real-time Feedback**
   - Test highlight responsiveness to mouse/touch position
   - Verify visual feedback performance under load
   - Confirm appropriate feedback for invalid positions

### 5. TurnIndicator Tests

#### Unit Tests (EditMode)
1. **Display Logic**
   - Verify correct display for black player's turn
   - Test correct display for white player's turn
   - Confirm display updates after turn changes

#### Integration Tests (PlayMode)
2. **UI Updates**
   - Test turn indicator visibility and clarity
   - Verify no display lag during turn transitions
   - Test visual distinction between player indicators

## Non-Functional Tests

### Performance Tests
1. **Placement Responsiveness**
   - Test piece placement completes within 16ms target
   - Verify consistent performance over extended play sessions
   - Test memory usage with many placed pieces

2. **Object Pooling Efficiency**
   - Verify objects reused from pool rather than instantiated
   - Test pool size management under different loads
   - Confirm no memory leaks in pooling system

### Compatibility Tests
1. **Cross-Platform Input**
   - Test identical behavior on Windows/Mac/Linux
   - Verify touch and mouse inputs produce same results
   - Test input behavior on different screen DPIs

### Edge Case Tests
1. **Rapid Consecutive Clicks**
   - Test system handling of double-clicks
   - Verify protection against accidental rapid placements
   - Test click handling during animation sequences

2. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Test all four corners of the board
   - Verify edge row/column behavior
   - Test center intersection specifically

## Risk-Based Tests

### High Priority Tests (Addressing HIGH Risk Items)
1. **LateUpdate() Conflict Testing**
   - Profile frame timing with piece placement in LateUpdate()
   - Test interaction with other LateUpdate() systems
   - Verify consistent frame rate during placement

2. **Input Method Differentiation**
   - Define and test specific behavior for touch vs. mouse
   - Verify no input method conflicts
   - Test hybrid input scenarios (touch and mouse in same session)

### Medium Priority Tests (Addressing MEDIUM Risk Items)
1. **Architecture Alignment Verification**
   - Cross-reference implementation with architecture document
   - Verify file paths match documented locations
   - Test component communication as specified

2. **Visual Feedback Coverage**
   - Create unit tests for all visual states
   - Test feedback system integration with placement logic
   - Verify accessibility of visual indicators

## Test Automation Strategy

### Unit Test Coverage Targets
- PiecePlacement: 90%
- TurnManager: 85%
- IntersectionDetector: 80%
- TurnIndicator: 75%

### Integration Test Coverage Targets
- Core gameplay flow: 100%
- Input handling: 90%
- Visual feedback: 80%
- Performance scenarios: 75%

## Test Data Requirements

### Static Test Data
- Predefined board states for specific test scenarios
- Standardized click sequences for repeatability
- Reference images for visual comparison tests

### Dynamic Test Data
- Randomized placement sequences for stress testing
- Variable timing data for performance tests
- Multi-user simulation data (if applicable)

## Special Considerations

### Performance Monitoring
- Frame time logging during placement operations
- Memory allocation tracking for object pooling
- CPU/GPU usage profiling

### Quality Gates
- All HIGH priority tests must pass before development merge
- 80% unit test coverage required for core components
- Performance baselines must be maintained or improved
