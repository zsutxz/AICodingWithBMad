# Responsive Layout Verification Plan: Story 2.1

## Purpose
Validate that the main menu layout remains functional and visually consistent across different screen resolutions and aspect ratios.

## Test Matrix

| Resolution | Aspect Ratio | Test Environment | Verification Criteria |
|------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1920x1080 | 16:9 | Windows Desktop | Layout maintains proper spacing, no clipping |
| 1280x720 | 16:9 | Windows Mobile | All UI elements fully visible and tappable |
| 3840x2160 | 16:9 | High-DPI Monitor | Text and icons scale appropriately |
| 2560x1440 | 16:9 | Standard Monitor | Layout adapts with no overlapping elements |
| 2048x1536 | 4:3 | Tablet | Menu components reflow appropriately |
| 1080x1920 | 9:16 | Mobile Portrait | Vertical layout maintains usability |

## Test Cases

1. **Screen Size Adaptation**
   - Verify UI elements maintain proper proportions at each resolution
   - Confirm text remains readable at smallest resolution (720p)
   - Check icons and interactive elements maintain minimum touch targets (48x48 pixels)

2. **Aspect Ratio Handling**
   - Test landscape vs portrait orientations
   - Verify layout elements reposition appropriately for different aspect ratios
   - Confirm no UI elements are cut off at extreme aspect ratios

3. **DPI Scaling**
   - Test at 100%, 150%, and 200% DPI scaling
   - Verify UI elements scale proportionally without pixelation

4. **Content Overflow**
   - Test with localized text at different lengths
   - Verify layout handles longer text in different languages

## Validation Steps
1. Open `MainMenu.unity` scene in Unity Editor
2. Set Game View to each resolution in the test matrix
3. Verify all UI elements:
   - Maintain proper spacing and alignment
   - Are fully visible and interactive
   - Have appropriate size for target platform
4. Document any layout issues found
5. Record video evidence for critical issues

## Pass Criteria
- All UI elements visible and functional at minimum resolution (720p)
- No overlapping or clipped content at any tested resolution
- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements
- Text remains readable at all resolutions

## Results Tracking
| Test Case | 720p | 1080p | 4K | 4:3 | Mobile | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|----|-----|--------|-------|
| Layout Integrity | | | | | | |
| Text Readability | | | | | | |
| Button Sizing | | | | | | |
| Visual Hierarchy | | | | | | |
