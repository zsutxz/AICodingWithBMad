## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- GameStateManager provides state management for menu transitions [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#63]
- UIManager component available for UI system management [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#64]
- AudioManager available for sound effects and background music [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#66]

### Data Models
- GameState ScriptableObject for managing MainMenu state [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#121]
- GameSettingsModel for storing menu preferences and audio settings [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#95-103]
- Scene references for MainMenu.unity and GameScene.unity [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#173-174]

### Component Specifications
- **MainMenuScreen**: UI component for main menu layout and button management
- **SceneLoader**: MonoBehaviour for handling scene transitions and loading [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#188]
- **ButtonHandler**: MonoBehaviour for button interactions and visual feedback [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]

### File Locations
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/MainMenuScreen.cs` - Main menu screen component
- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/MainMenuScreen.prefab` - Reusable main menu screen
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Scene/SceneLoader.cs` - Scene transition management
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/ButtonHandler.cs` - Button interaction system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/UIManager.cs` - UI management system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#202]
- `Assets/_Project/Scenes/MainMenu.unity` - Main menu scene [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#173]

### Technical Constraints
- Canvas must use "Scale With Screen Size" with 1920x1080 reference resolution [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#241]
- Scene transitions should use SceneManager.LoadScene() for synchronous loading [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#306]
- GameStateManager must persist across scenes using DontDestroyOnLoad() [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#302]
- Button interactions must use Unity Events for loose coupling [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#198]
- UI elements should use UIElements collision layer for proper interaction [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#279]
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]

### UI Design Strategy
- **Layout**: Clean, centered layout with prominent "Start Game" button
- **Visual Style**: Traditional Chinese aesthetic with appropriate colors and typography
- **Button Design**: Clear visual hierarchy with primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes and aspect ratios
- **Animation**: Subtle animations for button interactions and scene transitions
- **Audio**: Appropriate sound effects for menu interactions

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test MainMenuScreen button interactions and state management
  - Integration test scene transitions between MainMenu and GameScene
  - Performance test menu responsiveness on different screen resolutions
  - Validate button visual feedback (hover, click animations)
  - Test audio feedback for menu interactions
  - Verify GameStateManager persistence across scene changes
  - Test exit game functionality on different platforms
  - Validate responsive layout on various screen sizes and aspect ratios
  - Test menu navigation with keyboard and controller input
  - Ensure proper cleanup when transitioning between scenes
