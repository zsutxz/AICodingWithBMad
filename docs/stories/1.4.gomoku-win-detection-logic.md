# Story 1.4: Gomoku Win Detection Logic

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** the game to automatically detect when five pieces are connected in a row,
**so that** I know when the game is won and who the winner is.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Win detection works for horizontal five-in-a-row connections
2. Win detection works for vertical five-in-a-row connections
3. Win detection works for diagonal five-in-a-row connections
4. Game state transitions to "game over" when win is detected
5. Winner is correctly identified and displayed
6. No false positives for win detection in normal gameplay

  - [x] Test win detection with complex board states
  - [x] Ensure detection runs efficiently after each move in LateUpdate() [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#179]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- GameBoardModel provides 15x15 grid state (0=empty, 1=black, 2=white) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#81]
- Piece placement system manages turn-based piece placement [Source: docs/stories/1.3.basic-piece-placement-system.md#26-29]
- Game state management handles transitions between states [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#115-131]

### Data Models
- GameBoardModel stores board state in 15x15 array for win detection [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#81]
- currentPlayer tracks which player made the last move [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#82]
- moveHistory can be used for win detection optimization [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#83]

### Component Specifications
- **WinDetector**: MonoBehaviour for detecting five-in-a-row connections in all directions [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]
- **VictoryEffect**: MonoBehaviour for visual effects when win is detected [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#175]
- **WinCondition**: ScriptableObject for configurable win conditions [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#176]
- **VictoryBanner**: UI component for displaying winner information [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#212]

### File Locations
- `Assets/Scripts/Win/WinDetector.cs` - Main win detection logic [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#184]
- `Assets/Prefabs/Win/VictoryEffect.prefab` - Visual effects for victory [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#185]
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/VictoryBanner.cs` - UI component for winner display [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#212]
- `Assets/Scripts/Win/WinCondition.cs` - ScriptableObject for win rules
- `Assets/Tests/EditMode/WinDetectorTests.cs` - Unit tests for win detection
- `Assets/Tests/PlayMode/WinDetectorIntegrationTests.cs` - Integration tests for win detection and UI

### Technical Constraints
- Win detection must run after each move in LateUpdate() for performance [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#179]
- Use Unity Events to communicate victory to other systems [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#180]
- Implement efficient scanning algorithms to maintain 60 FPS performance
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]

### Win Detection Algorithm Strategy
- **Horizontal Scanning**: Scan each row from left to right, checking for 5 consecutive pieces
- **Vertical Scanning**: Scan each column from top to bottom, checking for 5 consecutive pieces
- **Diagonal Scanning**: Scan both main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right) and anti-diagonals (top-right to bottom-left)
- **Optimization**: Only scan around the last placed piece position to improve performance
- **Boundary Checking**: Ensure all scans stay within 15x15 grid boundaries

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test horizontal win detection with various piece configurations
  - Unit test vertical win detection with edge cases
  - Unit test diagonal win detection in both directions
  - Integration test win detection with actual game board state
  - Test win detection performance with full board scenarios
  - Validate no false positives in complex board states
  - Test winner identification accuracy for both players
  - Verify game state transitions correctly to "game over"
