# Story 1.3: Basic Piece Placement System

## Status
Approved with Recommendations

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to click on board intersections to place black and white pieces alternately,
**so that** I can play the basic game of Gomoku.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Click detection on board intersections works accurately
2. Black and white pieces placed alternately on valid intersections
3. Pieces cannot be placed on occupied intersections
4. Visual feedback shows valid placement locations
5. Turn indicator displays which player's turn it is
6. Piece placement is immediate with no noticeable lag

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Game board system provides 15x15 grid with intersection detection [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#135-149]
- Board uses traditional Chinese aesthetic with dark wood tones [Source: docs/stories/1.2.game-board-creation-and-display.md#26-27]
- Project structure follows Unity best practices with organized folders [Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-setup-and-basic-scene-structure.md#24-29]

### Data Models
- GameBoardModel stores board state in 15x15 array (0=empty, 1=black, 2=white) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#81]
- currentPlayer tracks which player's turn it is (1=black, 2=white) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#82]
- moveHistory stores sequence of moves for undo functionality [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#83]

### Component Specifications
- **PiecePlacement**: MonoBehaviour for piece placement logic, handles turn management and move validation [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#156]
- **Piece**: MonoBehaviour for game piece behavior, manages visual representation and interactions [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#157]
- **TurnManager**: MonoBehaviour for tracking current player and turn transitions [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#158]
- **IntersectionDetector**: MonoBehaviour for detecting clicks on board intersections [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#140]

### File Locations
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Piece/PiecePlacement.cs` - Main piece placement logic [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#166]
- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/Piece/Piece.prefab` - Reusable game piece component [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#167]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Piece/TurnManager.cs` - Turn management system
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/GameBoard/IntersectionDetector.cs` - Intersection click detection [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#140]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/TurnIndicator.cs` - UI component for turn display [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#378]

### Technical Constraints
- Use Unity Input System for cross-platform input handling [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#293]
- Implement object pooling for game pieces to minimize instantiation overhead [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#289]
- Use Rigidbody2D with Kinematic body type for game pieces [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#285]
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns: initialization in Awake/Start, gameplay logic in Update/LateUpdate [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]

### Cross-Platform Input Specifications
- **Mouse Input**: Use mouse position with single click detection (Fire1 action)
- **Touch Input**: Use touch position with tap gesture recognition
- **Input System Configuration**:
  - Create "PlacePiece" action in Input System with both mouse and touch bindings
  - Mouse binding: Left Mouse Button (Button 0)
  - Touch binding: Touch Contact (Primary Touch)
  - Action type: Button (Press and Release)
- **Platform Differences**:
  - Mouse: Precise cursor position, hover effects supported
  - Touch: Touch position, no hover effects, requires tap gesture
  - Both platforms should use the same intersection detection logic
  - Visual feedback should adapt to input method (hover vs tap highlight)

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test PiecePlacement component for valid/invalid move validation
  - Unit test TurnManager for correct turn transitions
  - Integration test click detection accuracy on board intersections
  - Performance test piece placement responsiveness
  - Validate visual feedback for valid placement locations
  - Test turn indicator updates correctly

### Enhanced Test Scenarios
- **Visual Feedback System Tests**:
  - Test hover highlight appears on valid intersections (mouse only)
  - Test tap highlight appears on valid intersections (touch only)
  - Test highlight disappears when moving away from intersection
  - Test highlight color changes based on current player
  - Test highlight disabled for occupied intersections
  - Test highlight persists during turn transitions

- **Turn Indicator UI Tests**:
  - Test turn indicator displays correct player color (black/white)
  - Test turn indicator updates immediately after piece placement
  - Test turn indicator text/icon changes based on current player
  - Test turn indicator maintains correct state across scene transitions
  - Test turn indicator handles edge cases (game start, game over)

- **Edge Case Tests**:
  - Test rapid consecutive clicks handled correctly
  - Test simultaneous touch/mouse input on same intersection
  - Test input during turn transitions
  - Test performance under heavy input load
  - Test cross-platform input consistency

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test complete piece placement flow (click → validation → placement → turn change)
  - Test visual feedback integration with piece placement
  - Test turn indicator integration with turn management
  - Test input system integration across platforms
