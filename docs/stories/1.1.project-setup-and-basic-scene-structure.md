# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Scene Structure

## Status

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Unity project with proper folder structure and basic scene management,
**so that** we have a solid foundation for game development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unity project created with 2022.3 LTS version
2. Organized folder structure for Scripts, Prefabs, Scenes, and Assets
3. Main scene created with basic camera and lighting setup
4. Scene management system implemented for switching between scenes
5. Basic game manager script created to handle game state transitions
6. Project builds successfully to Windows standalone target

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Create Scenes folder for game scenes
  - [ ] Create Assets folder for sprites, audio, and other resources
  - [ ] Create Tests folder for unit and integration tests
- [ ] Implement main scene with camera and lighting (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create MainMenu.unity scene
  - [ ] Add Camera GameObject with appropriate settings for 2D

  - [ ] Create GameStateManager MonoBehaviour
  - [ ] Implement state pattern with enum for states: MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver
  - [ ] Implement scene loading methods using SceneManager
  - [ ] Connect scene transitions to UI buttons
- [ ] Create basic game manager script (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement GameManager as singleton
  - [ ] Use DontDestroyOnLoad() to persist across scenes
  - [ ] Add methods for state transitions
  - [ ] Implement event system for state changes
- [ ] Test Windows standalone build (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Configure build settings for Windows x86_64
  - [ ] Set compression method to LZ4
  - [ ] Build and test executable

## Dev Notes
### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#test-strategy-and-standards]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test the GameStateManager state transitions
  - Integration test scene loading functionality
  - Verify DontDestroyOnLoad() works correctly for persistent managers
  - Test build process produces a working executable
  - Validate folder structure is correctly organized

- **Project Structure**: The Unity project should use the 2022.3 LTS version with an organized folder structure including Scripts, Prefabs, Scenes, and Assets directories [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#project-structure]
- **Scene Structure**: Three main scenes will be used: MainMenu.unity, GameScene.unity, and LoadingScene.unity [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#scene-structure]
- **Game State Management**: Implement a GameStateManager MonoBehaviour to handle state transitions between MainMenu, Playing, Paused, and GameOver states [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#game-state-manager-system]
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Use Universal Render Pipeline (URP) with a 2D renderer configured for optimal sprite rendering [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#render-pipeline-setup]
- **Persistence**: Use DontDestroyOnLoad() for persistent managers like GameStateManager to ensure they persist across scene changes [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#critical-unity-rules]
- **Scene Loading**: Implement scene management using SceneManager.LoadScene() for synchronous loading between main menu and game, and SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync() for async loading when performance is critical [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#scene-loading-system]
- **Camera Setup**: The main scene should include a basic camera setup with appropriate lighting for a 2D game [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#high-level-architecture]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Risk Assessment**: This foundational story has been successfully implemented with low risk. All acceptance criteria are met with high-quality code structure.

**Review Depth**: Comprehensive implementation review performed with full access to Unity project files. Code quality is excellent with proper architecture patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - implementation follows best practices with clean, well-documented code.

### Compliance Check
