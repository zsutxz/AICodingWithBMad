# Story 1.2: Game Board Creation and Display

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to see a 15x15 game board with clear grid lines and intersections,
**so that** I can understand the playing area and make strategic moves.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 15x15 game board rendered with visible grid lines
2. Board background uses appropriate traditional Chinese aesthetic
3. Grid intersections are clearly marked and spaced evenly
4. Board scales appropriately to different screen sizes
5. Board is centered on screen with proper margins
6. Grid coordinates optionally visible for debugging purposes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create 15x15 game board with visible grid lines (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design board grid using Unity's UI system or sprite rendering
  - [ ] Implement 15x15 grid with evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines
  - [ ] Ensure grid lines are clearly visible against the board background
  - [ ] Use appropriate line thickness and color for visibility
- [ ] Implement traditional Chinese aesthetic for board background (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create board background texture with dark wood tones inspired by traditional Go/Weiqi boards
  - [ ] Apply texture to board background with appropriate tiling
  - [ ] Ensure visual harmony with the overall game aesthetic
- [ ] Mark grid intersections clearly (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add visual markers at each intersection point
  - [ ] Ensure markers are evenly spaced and aligned with grid lines
  - [ ] Use subtle highlighting to indicate valid placement locations
- [ ] Implement responsive board scaling (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configure board to scale appropriately for different screen sizes and aspect ratios
  - [ ] Test scaling on common resolutions (1080p, 720p, 4K)
  - [ ] Ensure board maintains proper proportions on all screens
- [ ] Center board with proper margins (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Position board in center of screen with appropriate margins
  - [ ] Ensure board doesn't touch screen edges
  - [ ] Maintain consistent spacing around board on all sides
- [ ] Implement optional grid coordinates for debugging (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add option to display grid coordinates (A-O, 1-15) along board edges
  - [ ] Make coordinates toggleable via developer settings
  - [ ] Position coordinates clearly along horizontal and vertical axes

## Dev Notes
### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#test-strategy-and-standards]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test the GameBoard component initialization and configuration
  - Integration test the board rendering on different screen resolutions
  - Verify the 15x15 grid is correctly rendered with proper spacing
  - Test the responsive scaling on various screen sizes and aspect ratios
  - Validate the board is properly centered with appropriate margins
  - Test the optional grid coordinates display functionality
  - Verify the traditional Chinese aesthetic is properly applied to the board background

- **Game Board Implementation**: Create a GameBoard MonoBehaviour component to handle the rendering and interaction with the 15x15 game board [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#game-board-system]
- **Board Rendering**: Implement BoardRenderer MonoBehaviour for visual rendering of the board grid lines and background [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#game-board-system]
- **Intersection Detection**: Use IntersectionDetector MonoBehaviour for detecting clicks on board intersections, ensuring accurate click detection on valid intersections [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#game-board-system]
- **File Structure**: Create the following files:
  - `Assets/_Project/Scripts/GameBoard/GameBoard.cs` for the main board logic
  - `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/GameBoard/GameBoard.prefab` for the reusable board component [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#game-board-system]
- **Visual Design**: Implement the board with traditional Chinese aesthetic using dark wood tones for the background and stone colors for the pieces, following the branding guidelines [Source: docs/prd.md#branding]
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Use Universal Render Pipeline (URP) with a 2D renderer configured for optimal sprite rendering [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#render-pipeline-setup]
- **Sprite Management**: Create a single sprite atlas for all game sprites (board, pieces, UI elements) to minimize draw calls and improve performance [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#sprite-organization]
- **UI Scaling**: Configure the Canvas to "Scale With Screen Size" with a reference resolution of 1920x1080 to ensure proper scaling across different screen sizes [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#ui-scaling]
- **Physics Configuration**: Use Unity's 2D physics system for efficient collision detection, with appropriate collision layers configured to prevent unnecessary checks between game pieces [Source: docs/prd.md#performance-considerations]
