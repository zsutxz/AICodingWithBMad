# Story 2.3: Visual Polish and Animation Effects

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** smooth animations and visual feedback for game actions,
**so that** the game feels responsive and polished.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Piece placement includes smooth fade-in or scale animation
2. Win detection highlights the winning five pieces
3. Turn transitions have subtle visual indicators
4. Button interactions include hover and click animations
5. Game state changes have appropriate visual transitions
6. Animations are performant and don't impact gameplay

- GameStateManager provides state management for game transitions [Source: docs/stories/2.1.main-menu-and-navigation-system.md#dev-notes]
- TurnIndicator component implemented for player turn display [Source: docs/stories/2.2.in-game-ui-and-player-information.md#tasks-subtasks]
- UIManager available for UI system coordination [Source: docs/stories/2.2.in-game-ui-and-player-information.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- GameSettingsModel includes `enableAnimations` boolean for animation toggles [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#102]
- GameBoardModel provides access to piece positions and game state [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#99-103]
- GameState ScriptableObject manages state transitions [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#121]

### Component Specifications
- **PieceAnimation**: MonoBehaviour for piece placement animations (fade-in, scale)
- **VictoryEffect**: MonoBehaviour for highlighting winning pieces [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#175]
- **TurnTransition**: MonoBehaviour for visual turn change indicators
- **ButtonHandler**: MonoBehaviour for button interactions with animation support [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- **GameStateTransition**: MonoBehaviour for state change visual effects
- **GameStateManager**: MonoBehaviour for state management [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#120]
- **WinDetector**: MonoBehaviour for win condition detection [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]

### File Locations
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Animation/PieceAnimation.cs` - Piece placement animation component
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Animation/VictoryEffect.cs` - Victory highlight effect component
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Animation/TurnTransition.cs` - Turn transition visual component
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Animation/GameStateTransition.cs` - State transition effects
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/ButtonHandler.cs` - Enhanced button animation system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/GameState/GameStateManager.cs` - State management [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#120]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Win/WinDetector.cs` - Win detection system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]
- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/Animation/` - Animation component prefabs
- `Assets/_Project/Shaders/VictoryGlow.shader` - Custom shader for victory highlight [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#486]

### Technical Constraints
- Animations must respect `enableAnimations` setting in GameSettingsModel [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#102]
- Use Unity's Animation system or DOTween for smooth animations
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]
- Use object pooling for frequently used animations to avoid instantiation overhead [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#684]
- Particle effects limited to 50 particles maximum for performance [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#531]
- Canvas must use "Scale With Screen Size" with 1920x1080 reference resolution [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#241]

### Animation Design Strategy
- **Piece Placement**: Smooth fade-in (0.3s) with subtle scale effect
- **Victory Highlight**: Glowing outline with pulse animation (1.5s duration)
- **Turn Transitions**: Color fade between black and white player indicators
- **Button Interactions**: Scale down on press, color change on hover
- **State Transitions**: Screen fade effects (0.5s) between game states
- **Performance**: Animation quality settings for different device capabilities

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test animation component initialization and state changes
  - Integration test animation triggering with game systems
  - Performance test animation frame rates on target platforms
  - Validate animation respects GameSettingsModel.enableAnimations setting
  - Test animation pooling system efficiency
  - Verify victory highlight visibility and timing
  - Test button animation responsiveness and visual feedback
  - Validate state transition smoothness and timing
  - Test animation fallbacks when animations are disabled
  - Performance profiling for animation systems on different devices
