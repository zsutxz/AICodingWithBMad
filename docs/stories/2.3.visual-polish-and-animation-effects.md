- `Assets/_Project/Shaders/VictoryGlow.shader` - Custom shader for victory highlight [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#486]

### Technical Constraints
- Animations must respect `enableAnimations` setting in GameSettingsModel [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#102]
- Use Unity's Animation system or DOTween for smooth animations
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]
- Use object pooling for frequently used animations to avoid instantiation overhead [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#684]
- Particle effects limited to 50 particles maximum for performance [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#531]
- Canvas must use "Scale With Screen Size" with 1920x1080 reference resolution [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#241]

### Animation Design Strategy
- **Piece Placement**: Smooth fade-in (0.3s) with subtle scale effect
- **Victory Highlight**: Glowing outline with pulse animation (1.5s duration)
- **Turn Transitions**: Color fade between black and white player indicators
- **Button Interactions**: Scale down on press, color change on hover
- **State Transitions**: Screen fade effects (0.5s) between game states
- **Performance**: Animation quality settings for different device capabilities

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test animation component initialization and state changes
  - Integration test animation triggering with game systems
  - Performance test animation frame rates on target platforms
  - Validate animation respects GameSettingsModel.enableAnimations setting
  - Test animation pooling system efficiency
  - Verify victory highlight visibility and timing
