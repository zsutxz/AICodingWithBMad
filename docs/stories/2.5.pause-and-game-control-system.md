## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 (Audio System): Audio system should handle pause state properly - audio should pause/resume with game state. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.audio-system-and-sound-effects.md#112]

### Data Models
- **GameStateManager** manages states: MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#117]
- **GameBoardModel** stores board state, current player, move history - must be preserved during pause [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#76-83]
- **GameSettingsModel** stores audio and UI settings - accessible from pause menu [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#94-104]

### API Specifications
- **GameStateManager** should provide Pause() and Resume() methods [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#117]
- **UIManager** should handle pause menu screen activation/deactivation [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#361]
- **Input System** should map ESC key to pause functionality [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#327]

### Component Specifications
- **UIManager**: Singleton manager for all UI screens including pause menu [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#192]
- **ScreenManager**: Manages screen activation/deactivation - should handle pause menu [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#193]
- **ButtonHandler**: Handles UI button interactions - should handle pause menu buttons [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- **GameStateManager**: Manages game state transitions including pause/resume [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#117]

### File Locations

- **UI Scripts**: `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/UIManager.cs` [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#202]
- **Prefabs**: `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/UIManager.prefab` [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#203]
- **Pause Menu Assets**: Should be created in `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/PauseMenu/`

### Technical Constraints
- **Unity Version**: 2022.3 LTS [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#66]
- **C# Version**: 10.0 [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#665]
- **Input System**: Unity Input System 1.7.0 [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#69]
- **UI Framework**: UGUI (Unity UI) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#353]

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: 80% coverage for game logic components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Test Distribution**: 70% Edit Mode tests, 30% Play Mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#701]

#### Specific Testing Requirements
- Unit test GameStateManager pause/resume transitions
- Integration test pause menu UI interactions
- Test game state preservation across pause cycles
- Verify ESC key and UI button both trigger pause
- Test pause functionality in different game scenarios
- Ensure audio system respects pause state
- Validate visual pause indicators work correctly
