# Story 2.5: Pause and Game Control System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to pause the game and access options during gameplay,
**so that** I can take breaks or adjust settings as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pause functionality accessible via keyboard (ESC) and UI button
2. Pause menu overlay with resume, settings, and quit options
3. Game state properly preserved when paused and resumed
4. Pause menu follows the established UI design patterns
5. Time-based elements (if any) properly handle pause state
6. Pause state is clearly indicated visually

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 (Audio System): Audio system should handle pause state properly - audio should pause/resume with game state. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.audio-system-and-sound-effects.md#112]

### Data Models
- **GameStateManager** manages states: MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#117]
- **GameBoardModel** stores board state, current player, move history - must be preserved during pause [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#76-83]
- **GameSettingsModel** stores audio and UI settings - accessible from pause menu [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#94-104]

### API Specifications
- **GameStateManager** should provide Pause() and Resume() methods [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#117]
- **UIManager** should handle pause menu screen activation/deactivation [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#361]
- **Input System** should map ESC key to pause functionality [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#327]

### Component Specifications
- **UIManager**: Singleton manager for all UI screens including pause menu [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#192]
- **ScreenManager**: Manages screen activation/deactivation - should handle pause menu [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#193]
- **ButtonHandler**: Handles UI button interactions - should handle pause menu buttons [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- **GameStateManager**: Manages game state transitions including pause/resume [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#117]

### File Locations
- **Scripts**: `Assets/_Project/Scripts/GameState/GameStateManager.cs` [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#130]
- **UI Scripts**: `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/UIManager.cs` [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#202]
- **Prefabs**: `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/UIManager.prefab` [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#203]
- **Pause Menu Assets**: Should be created in `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/PauseMenu/`

### Technical Constraints
- **Unity Version**: 2022.3 LTS [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#66]
- **C# Version**: 10.0 [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#665]
- **Input System**: Unity Input System 1.7.0 [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#69]
- **UI Framework**: UGUI (Unity UI) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#353]

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: 80% coverage for game logic components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Test Distribution**: 70% Edit Mode tests, 30% Play Mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#701]

#### Specific Testing Requirements
- Unit test GameStateManager pause/resume transitions
- Integration test pause menu UI interactions
- Test game state preservation across pause cycles
- Verify ESC key and UI button both trigger pause
- Test pause functionality in different game scenarios
- Ensure audio system respects pause state
- Validate visual pause indicators work correctly
