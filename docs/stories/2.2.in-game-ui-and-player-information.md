### Previous Story Insights
- UIManager component available for UI system coordination [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#64]
- ButtonHandler MonoBehaviour implemented for button interactions [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#65]
- GameStateManager provides state management for game transitions [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#63]

### Data Models
- GameBoardModel for accessing move history to calculate move count [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#385]
- GameState ScriptableObject for managing Playing and Paused states [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#121]

### Component Specifications
- **TurnIndicator**: UI component for displaying current player turn
- **MoveCounter**: UI component for displaying number of moves played
- **PauseButton**: UI button for accessing pause functionality
- **UIManager**: MonoBehaviour for overall UI system coordination [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#192]
- **GameStateManager**: MonoBehaviour for state transitions between Playing and Paused [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#120]
- **SceneLoader**: MonoBehaviour for handling scene transitions and pause functionality [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#188]

### File Locations

- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/TurnIndicator.prefab` - Reusable turn indicator
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/MoveCounter.cs` - Move counter component
- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/MoveCounter.prefab` - Reusable move counter

- `Assets/_Project/Scenes/GameScene.unity` - Main game scene [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]

### Technical Constraints
- Canvas must use "Scale With Screen Size" with 1920x1080 reference resolution [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#241]
- UI elements should use UIElements collision layer for proper interaction [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#279]
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]
- Button interactions must use Unity Events for loose coupling [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#198]
- All UI components must be created as prefabs for reuse [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#572]

### UI Design Strategy
- **Layout**: Clean, balanced layout with information positioned at screen corners
- **Visual Style**: Traditional Chinese aesthetic with appropriate colors and typography
- **Information Hierarchy**: Turn information most prominent, followed by move count and controls
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes and aspect ratios
- **Animation**: Subtle animations for state changes and interactions

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test TurnIndicator state changes and UI updates
  - Integration test move counter with GameBoardModel.moveHistory
  - Validate responsive layout on various screen sizes and aspect ratios
  - Test pause functionality and UI state changes
  - Verify TurnIndicator updates correctly with GameStateManager
  - Test MoveCounter accuracy with different game sequences
  - Validate UI scaling on different resolutions (1080p, 720p, 4K)
  - Test touch input on game controls for mobile compatibility
  - Ensure UI elements do not obstruct board view in different orientations
  - Verify all UI components are properly initialized in Awake/Start methods
