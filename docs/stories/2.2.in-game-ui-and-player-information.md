# Story 2.2: In-Game UI and Player Information

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to see clear game information and controls during gameplay,
**so that** I can understand the game state and access features easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Turn indicator clearly shows current player (Black/White)
2. Game controls (pause, menu) are accessible during gameplay
3. Move counter displays number of moves played
4. UI elements follow the established visual design language
5. Game information is positioned non-intrusively around the board
6. UI scales appropriately for different resolutions

## Dev Notes
### Implementation Summary
- **TurnIndicator**: Created with turn management integration and visual feedback
- **MoveCounter**: Implemented with GameBoardModel integration and milestone animations
- **PauseButton**: Developed with GameStateManager integration and visual feedback
- **UI Management System**: Created comprehensive UI management components:
  - UIStyleManager for visual design consistency
  - UILayoutManager for non-intrusive positioning
  - UIScaler for responsive UI scaling
  - UIGameStateIntegrator for state management integration
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests created for all UI components
- **Architecture**: Followed Unity best practices with proper event-driven patterns

### Previous Story Insights
- UIManager component available for UI system coordination [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#64]
- ButtonHandler MonoBehaviour implemented for button interactions [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#65]
- GameStateManager provides state management for game transitions [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#63]

### Data Models
- GameBoardModel for accessing move history to calculate move count [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#385]
- GameState ScriptableObject for managing Playing and Paused states [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#121]

### Component Specifications
- **TurnIndicator**: UI component for displaying current player turn
- **MoveCounter**: UI component for displaying number of moves played
- **PauseButton**: UI button for accessing pause functionality
- **UIManager**: MonoBehaviour for overall UI system coordination [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#192]
- **GameStateManager**: MonoBehaviour for state transitions between Playing and Paused [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#120]
- **SceneLoader**: MonoBehaviour for handling scene transitions and pause functionality [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#188]

- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/TurnIndicator.prefab` - Reusable turn indicator
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/MoveCounter.cs` - Move counter component
- `Assets/_Project/Prefabs/UI/MoveCounter.prefab` - Reusable move counter

- `Assets/_Project/Scenes/GameScene.unity` - Main game scene [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]

### Technical Constraints
- Canvas must use "Scale With Screen Size" with 1920x1080 reference resolution [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#241]
- UI elements should use UIElements collision layer for proper interaction [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#279]
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]
- Button interactions must use Unity Events for loose coupling [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#198]
- All UI components must be created as prefabs for reuse [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#572]

### UI Design Strategy
- **Layout**: Clean, balanced layout with information positioned at screen corners
- **Visual Style**: Traditional Chinese aesthetic with appropriate colors and typography
- **Information Hierarchy**: Turn information most prominent, followed by move count and controls
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes and aspect ratios
- **Animation**: Subtle animations for state changes and interactions

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test TurnIndicator state changes and UI updates
  - Integration test move counter with GameBoardModel.moveHistory
  - Validate responsive layout on various screen sizes and aspect ratios
  - Test pause functionality and UI state changes
  - Verify TurnIndicator updates correctly with GameStateManager
  - Test MoveCounter accuracy with different game sequences
  - Validate UI scaling on different resolutions (1080p, 720p, 4K)
  - Test touch input on game controls for mobile compatibility
  - Ensure UI elements do not obstruct board view in different orientations
  - Verify all UI components are properly initialized in Awake/Start methods
