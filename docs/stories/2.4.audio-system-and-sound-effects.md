## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- AudioManager component available for audio management [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#66]
- ButtonHandler component implemented for UI interactions [Source: docs/stories/2.1.main-menu-and-navigation-system.md#65]
- WinDetector provides victory detection events [Source: docs/stories/1.4.gomoku-win-detection-logic.md#36-39]
- GameSettingsModel includes settings persistence [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-game-flow-and-state-management.md#60]

### Data Models
- GameSettingsModel stores audio preferences including volume levels and mute state [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#95-103]
- GameState ScriptableObject manages current game state for context-appropriate audio [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#121]

### Component Specifications
- **AudioManager**: MonoBehaviour for managing all audio playback and mixer settings [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#96]
- **ButtonHandler**: MonoBehaviour for handling UI button interactions with audio feedback [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- **WinDetector**: MonoBehaviour for detecting win conditions and triggering victory audio [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]
- **PiecePlacement**: MonoBehaviour for handling piece placement logic with audio feedback [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#156]
- **GameStateManager**: MonoBehaviour for state transitions that may affect audio [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#120]

### File Locations
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Audio/AudioManager.cs` - Main audio management system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#106]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/ButtonHandler.cs` - Button interaction system with audio integration [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#194]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Win/WinDetector.cs` - Win detection system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#174]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Piece/PiecePlacement.cs` - Piece placement system [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#156]
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/GameState/GameStateManager.cs` - State management [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#120]
- `Assets/_Project/Resources/Audio/` - Audio clips directory

### Technical Constraints
- AudioManager must use singleton pattern for global access [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#380]
- Audio settings must be saved and loaded using GameSettingsModel [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#102]
- Sound effects should be under 1 second in duration to avoid intrusion [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#530]
- Use Unity's AudioSource component for playing sounds [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#287]
- Follow Unity lifecycle patterns with initialization in Awake/Start [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#256]
- Audio mixer snapshots should be used for smooth transitions between game states [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#452]

### Audio Design Strategy
- **Piece Placement**: Short, subtle stone-on-wood sound effect that reinforces successful placement
- **Victory**: Clear chime or bell sound that celebrates the win without being overwhelming
- **Menu Interactions**: Distinct click sounds for button presses, subtle hover sounds for navigation
- **Volume Levels**: Balanced mix where UI sounds are slightly louder than game sounds, music at background level
- **Accessibility**: Visual indicators accompany important audio cues for hearing-impaired players

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in `Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/` for unit tests and `Assets/_Project/Tests/PlayMode/` for integration tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#708,714]
- **Test Standards**: Follow Unity Test Framework (NUnit-based) standards as specified in the architecture document [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#696-697]
- **Testing Framework**: Use Unity Test Framework for both edit mode and play mode tests [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#703]
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage for game logic components and 50% coverage for UI components [Source: docs/game-architecture.md#700]
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit test AudioManager methods for proper sound playback
  - Integration test piece placement audio with actual game board interactions
  - Verify victory sound triggers only once per win
  - Test audio settings persistence across game sessions
  - Validate volume controls adjust mixer levels correctly
  - Test audio feedback for all menu interactions
  - Ensure sounds do not overlap or cause audio glitches
  - Performance test audio memory usage and loading times
  - Verify audio works correctly in all game states (main menu, playing, paused, game over)
  - Test mute functionality across all audio categories
