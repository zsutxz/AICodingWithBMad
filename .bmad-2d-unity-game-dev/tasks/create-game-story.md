# Create Game Story Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical game story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Game Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, Unity-specific requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Game Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow

- Load `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy core-config.yaml from GITHUB bmad-core/ and configure it for your game project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure before proceeding."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `gdd.*`, `gamearchitecture.*`, `workflow.*`

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

#### 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories

- Based on `gddSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic GDD sections)
- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
- **If highest story exists:**
  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"

### 2. Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context

- Extract story requirements from the identified epic file or GDD section
- If previous story exists, review Dev Agent Record sections for:
  - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
  - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
  - Unity-specific challenges (prefab issues, scene management, performance)
  - Asset pipeline decisions and optimizations
- Extract relevant insights that inform the current story's preparation

### 3. Gather Architecture Context

#### 3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy

- **If `gamearchitectureVersion: >= v3` and `gamearchitectureSharded: true`**: Read `{gamearchitectureShardedLocation}/index.md` then follow structured reading order below
- **Else**: Use monolithic `gamearchitectureFile` for similar sections

#### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type

**For ALL Game Stories:** tech-stack.md, unity-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-resilience-architecture.md

**For Gameplay/Mechanics Stories, additionally:** gameplay-systems-architecture.md, component-architecture-details.md, physics-config.md, input-system.md, state-machines.md, game-data-models.md

**For UI/UX Stories, additionally:** ui-architecture.md, ui-components.md, ui-state-management.md, scene-management.md

**For Backend/Services Stories, additionally:** game-data-models.md, data-persistence.md, save-system.md, analytics-integration.md, multiplayer-architecture.md

**For Graphics/Rendering Stories, additionally:** rendering-pipeline.md, shader-guidelines.md, sprite-management.md, particle-systems.md

**For Audio Stories, additionally:** audio-architecture.md, audio-mixing.md, sound-banks.md

#### 3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details

Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story. Do NOT invent new patterns, systems, or standards not in the source documents.

Extract:

- Specific Unity components and MonoBehaviours the story will use
- Unity Package Manager dependencies and their APIs (e.g., Cinemachine, Input System, URP)
- Package-specific configurations and setup requirements
- Prefab structures and scene organization requirements
- Input system bindings and configurations
- Physics settings and collision layers
- UI canvas and layout specifications
- Asset naming conventions and folder structures
- Performance budgets (target FPS, memory limits, draw calls)
- Platform-specific considerations (mobile vs desktop)
- Testing requirements specific to Unity features

ALWAYS cite source documents: `[Source: gamearchitecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

### 4. Unity-Specific Technical Analysis

#### 4.1 Package Dependencies Analysis

- Identify Unity Package Manager packages required for the story
- Document package versions from manifest.json
- Note any package-specific APIs or components being used
- List package configuration requirements (e.g., Input System settings, URP asset config)
- Identify any third-party Asset Store packages and their integration points

#### 4.2 Scene and Prefab Planning

- Identify which scenes will be modified or created
- List prefabs that need to be created or updated
- Document prefab variant requirements
- Specify scene loading/unloading requirements

#### 4.3 Component Architecture

- Define MonoBehaviour scripts needed
- Specify ScriptableObject assets required
- Document component dependencies and execution order
- Identify required Unity Events and UnityActions
- Note any package-specific components (e.g., Cinemachine VirtualCamera, InputActionAsset)

#### 4.4 Asset Requirements

- List sprite/texture requirements with resolution specs
- Define animation clips and animator controllers needed
- Specify audio clips and their import settings
- Document any shader or material requirements
- Note any package-specific assets (e.g., URP materials, Input Action maps)

### 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context

- Create new story file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` using Game Story Template
- Fill in basic story information: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, Acceptance Criteria from Epic/GDD
- **`Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**
  - CRITICAL: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from gamearchitecture documents and GDD. NEVER invent or assume technical details.
  - Include ALL relevant technical details from Steps 2-4, organized by category:
    - **Previous Story Insights**: Key learnings from previous story implementation
    - **Package Dependencies**: Unity packages required, versions, configurations [with source references]
    - **Unity Components**: Specific MonoBehaviours, ScriptableObjects, systems [with source references]
    - **Scene & Prefab Specs**: Scene modifications, prefab structures, variants [with source references]

    - **Performance Targets**: FPS targets, memory budgets, profiler metrics
    - **Platform Considerations**: Mobile vs desktop differences, input variations
    - **Testing Requirements**: PlayMode tests, Unity Test Framework specifics
  - Every technical detail MUST include its source reference: `[Source: gamearchitecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
  - If information for a category is not found in the gamearchitecture docs, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in gamearchitecture docs"
- **`Tasks / Subtasks` section:**
  - Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic/GDD Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed GameArchitecture Information
  - Include Unity-specific tasks:

    - Prefab creation and testing
    - Component implementation with proper lifecycle methods
    - Input system integration
    - Physics configuration
    - UI implementation with proper anchoring
    - Performance profiling checkpoints
  - Each task must reference relevant gamearchitecture documentation
  - Include PlayMode testing as explicit subtasks
  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`)
- Add notes on Unity project structure alignment or discrepancies found in Step 4

### 6. Story Draft Completion and Review
