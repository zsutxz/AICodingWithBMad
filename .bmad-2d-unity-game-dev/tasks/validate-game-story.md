# Validate Game Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a Unity 2D game development story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it contains all necessary Unity-specific technical context, game development requirements, and implementation details. This specialized validation prevents hallucinations, ensures Unity development readiness, and validates game-specific acceptance criteria and testing approaches.
