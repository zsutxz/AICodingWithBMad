    title: Goals and Background Context
    instruction: |
      Ask if Project Brief document is available. If NO Project Brief exists, STRONGLY recommend creating one first using project-brief-tmpl (it provides essential foundation: problem statement, target users, success metrics, MVP scope, constraints). If user insists on GDD without brief, gather this information during Goals section. If Project Brief exists, review and use it to populate Goals (bullet list of desired game development outcomes) and Background Context (1-2 paragraphs on what game concept this will deliver and why) so we can determine what is and is not in scope for the GDD. Include Change Log table for version tracking.

  - id: epic-list
    title: Epic List
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

      - Each epic should be focused on a single phase and it's design from the development-phases section and deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish Phase 1: Unity Foundation & Core Systems (Project setup, input handling, basic scene management) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API, component, or scriptableobject completed can deliver value even if a scene, or gameobject is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Epic 1: Unity Foundation & Core Systems: Project setup, input handling, basic scene management"
      - "Epic 2: Core Game Mechanics: Player controller, physics systems, basic gameplay loop"
      - "Epic 3: Level Systems & Content Pipeline: Scene loading, prefab systems, level progression"
      - "Epic 4: Polish & Platform Optimization: Performance tuning, platform-specific features, deployment"

  - id: epic-details
    title: Epic {{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}
    repeatable: true
    instruction: |
      After the epic list is approved, present each epic with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit.

      For each epic provide expanded goal (2-3 sentences describing the objective and value all the stories will achieve).

      CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:

      - Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
      - Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality aside from early enabler stories for project foundation
      - No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
      - Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
      - Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
      - Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
      - Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
      - Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
      - If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice
