This is a placeholder file for the SceneLoader prefab.

In the Unity Editor, create a prefab by:
1. Creating an empty GameObject in the scene named "SceneLoader"
2. Adding the SceneLoader.cs component to it
3. Configuring the component with references to loading screen and progress bar
4. Dragging the GameObject from the hierarchy to this folder to create the prefab

The prefab will be used to instantiate the SceneLoader in scenes.
