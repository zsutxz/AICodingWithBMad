This is a placeholder file for the GameManager prefab.

In the Unity Editor, create a prefab by:
1. Creating an empty GameObject in the scene named "GameManager"
2. Adding the GameManager.cs component to it
3. Dragging the GameObject from the hierarchy to this folder to create the prefab

The prefab will be used to instantiate the GameManager in scenes.
