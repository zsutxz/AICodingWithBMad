This is a placeholder file for the GameStateManager prefab.

In the Unity Editor, create a prefab by:
1. Creating an empty GameObject in the scene named "GameStateManager"
2. Adding the GameStateManager.cs component to it
3. Dragging the GameObject from the hierarchy to this folder to create the prefab
4. Setting up the prefab with appropriate references to UI Manager and Audio Manager

The prefab will be used to instantiate the GameStateManager in scenes.
