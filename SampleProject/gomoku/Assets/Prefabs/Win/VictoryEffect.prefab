This is a placeholder for the VictoryEffect prefab.

In Unity, create a prefab with visual effects (particles, animations, etc.) that plays when a player wins the game.

The prefab should be instantiated when a win is detected by the WinDetector.

It should be configured to:
- Play a victory animation or particle effect
- Be positioned appropriately on the board
- Auto-destroy after playing
- Be triggered by the WinDetector's onWinDetected event
